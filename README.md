## Summary 

There will be over 90,000 employees retiring with only about 1,500 qualified for the mentorship program. This is a serious desparity that will require recuiting tens of thousands of very experienced employees that would be qualified for the mentorship program. Pewlett Hackard will be in dire straights without immediate intervention.
